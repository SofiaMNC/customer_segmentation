This study in 2 notebooks aims segment Olist's clients by exploiting their anonymized customer database, containing information pertaining to their clients' purchase history, satisfactions and localization since january 2017.
___

This study is divided into 2 notebooks: 
- A cleaning up, feature engineering and EDA notebook
- A modeling and prediction notebook
